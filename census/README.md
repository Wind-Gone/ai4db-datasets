# Census

### Introduction

This dataset is extracted from the 1994 Census database, consisting of person income information. It contains 48K tuples and 15 columns, among which 9 are categorical columns.

Cardinality estimation tasks using this dataset typically utilize 14 out of the 15 columns, excluding the "fnlwgt" column. These 14 columns comprise a mix of categorical and numerical attributes, with domain sizes ranging from 2 to 123.

### How to Get
The original dataset, which contains 15 columns, can be downloaded from the UCI website: [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult).
